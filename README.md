# SQL Basics and Prerequisites

Before diving into SQL problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, it's essential to have a good grasp of the basics. This guide provides a quick overview of some fundamental SQL concepts and common query functions:  [PREREQUISITED.MD](https://github.com/ayushichoudhary-19/SQL-QUESTIONS-AND-NOTES/blob/main/PREREQUISITES.MD))

**Now, that you're ready:**
# LET'S GO!
### PROBLEM - 1
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-6/problem
  
   **Solution:**
```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%';
```
> ðŸ’¡ I initialy did a mistake in using `=` sign as in `WHERE CITY LIKE = 'a%'` But we aren't suppoed to use `=` with `LIKE` 

### PROBLEM - 2
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-7/problem
  
   **Solution:**
```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u' 
```
> Same as above one


### PROBLEM - 3
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-8/problem
  
   **Solution:**
```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u')
AND CITY IN (SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%' );

```
> A nested variation of two of the above problems



### PROBLEM - 4
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-9/problem
  
   **Solution:**
```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u')
AND CITY IN (SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%' );

```


### PROBLEM - 5
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/more-than-75-marks/problem
  
   **Solution:**
```
SELECT NAME 
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE MARKS>75 
ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME,3), ID ASC;

```

> There are a lot of takeaways in this problem. Firstly you get to know about using a secondary order and right string function also. Here is more about it.
> In SQL, `RIGHT()` is a string function that is used to extract a specified number of characters from the right end (end of the string) of a given string. The syntax for the `RIGHT()` function is as follows:
```sql
RIGHT(string_expression, number_of_characters)
```

> - `string_expression`: This is the input string from which you want to extract characters. - `number_of_characters`: This is an integer value that specifies how many characters you want to extract from the right end of the input string.

Here's an example of how to use the `RIGHT()` function:

```sql
SELECT RIGHT('Hello, World!', 6); -- This returns 'World!'
```

### PROBLEM - 5
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/name-of-employees/problem
  
   **Solution:**
   

```
SELECT NAME 
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY NAME;
```
> It's written as OREDER <space> BY and not OREDERBY :)
